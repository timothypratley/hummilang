____
Hummingbirds have a variety of calls, chips, chatters and squeals to communicate with each other.
____

I'm pretty sure they communicate in LISP, so Hummilang is a LISP.

== Goals

. Implement a Lisp according to "Lisp in small pieces".
. Run programs of a more mathematically compatible notation.
. Render correctly as http://asciimath.org/[AsciiMath]

== Status

* [x] Evaluator
* [x] Parser
* [ ] Data structures
* [ ] Syntactic sugar
* [ ] Core
* [ ] Compiler

== Math notation

Popular languages diverge from math notation.

* `{}` should be sets.
* `()` or `[]` should be ordered pairs, tuples.
* `{(k, v)...}` should be mappings
* Ranges `[0,1) [0,1] (0,1] (0,1)` overlap with pairs/tuples and are asymmetrical.
* `=>` is a binary operator that should yield TRUE given FALSE (from falsehood, anything follows).

I'd prefer to code in math notation even if it's harder to write, I claim it would be easier to read (this is quite a stretch, I'm insisting that the benefits of an axiomatic basis for notation is more powerful than linguistic colloquialism).
ZFC lays out the scientific community's common language,
I think having a strong common root of expression has benefits.

== Constructs

=== Data literals

Numbers `1 1.1 pi 3i`

There only one numerical type

Strings `"this is a string"`

List literals `[1 1 2]`

Lists allow modification at both ends, and random reads and writes. Due to relaxed radix structure, they also have near constant-time slices and concatenation.

Set literals `{1 2 3}`

Sets are sorted for logn index and map lookup

Maps are a special case of sets and lists `{[1 2] [3 4] [5 6]}`

Indexes are represented as `{["e" "a" "v" "t"] ...}`

=== Operators

`1 + 2` is syntactic sugar for the list `[$ + 1 2]`

Operators bind according to math infix rules

=== Grouping

Parenthesis are used for grouping `()`.

=== Functions

`[f(1)]` is syntactic sugar for `[$ f [1]]`

`[f(x) = x + 1]` is syntactic sugar for `[$ defn [f [x] [$ + x 1]]]`
